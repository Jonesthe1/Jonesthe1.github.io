  <h2>All about me</h2>
 
<b>My story</b>	
  <p>I grew up in Rochester, NY. After 1st attending public school, I attended a private school to better my football carrer.

          <li>Something I love to look foward to.</li>
          <li>I can feel like I have accomplished something.</li>
      
      <h3>What Inspired me</h3>     
      <ol>
          <li>My father inspired me to work hard and get into a D1 school.</li>
          <li>Seeing my favorite players on T.V. since i was a kid.</li>
<h4>Rochester, NY</h4>
     <p>Being from upstate NY means a lot of snow and not much to do. There is no D1 schools in the area, so I had to work hard to get offers from outside schools.
       I also had to make sure my grades were good so I could succeed.
