          <li>Something I love to look foward to.</li>
          <li>I can feel like I have accomplished something.</li>
      
      <h3>What Inspired me</h3>     
      <ol>
          <li>My father inspired me to work hard and get into a D1 school.</li>
          <li>Seeing my favorite players on T.V. since i was a kid.</li>
<h4>Rochester, NY</h4>
     <p>Being from upstate NY means a lot of snow and not much to do. There is no D1 schools in the area, so I had to work hard to get offers from outside schools.
       I also had to make sure my grades were good so I could succeed.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                    
  <b>My Friends and Family</b>
   <p>Everyday my family and friends show me constant support which makes me iprove as a player. My family was alwayd close growing up so I knew that when I decided I wanted to take football more seriously, they would be on board.<p/>
